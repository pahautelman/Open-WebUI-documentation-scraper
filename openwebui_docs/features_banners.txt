🔰 Customizable Banners

Overview​

Open WebUI provides a feature that allows administrators to create customizable banners with persistence in the config.json file. These banners can feature options for content, background color (info, warning, error, or success), and dismissibility. Banners are accessible only to logged-in users, ensuring the confidentiality of sensitive information.

Configuring Banners through Environment Variables​

Alternatively, you can configure banners through environment variables. To do this, you will need to set the WEBUI_BANNERS environment variable with a list of dictionaries in the following format:

WEBUI_BANNERS

[{"id": "string","type": "string [info, success, warning, error]","title": "string","content": "string","dismissible": False,"timestamp": 1000}]

[{"id": "string","type": "string [info, success, warning, error]","title": "string","content": "string","dismissible": False,"timestamp": 1000}]

For more information on configuring environment variables in Open WebUI, see Environment Variable Configuration.
