🔒HTTPS Encryption

Overview​

While HTTPS encryption is not required to operate Open WebUI in most cases, certain features—such as Voice Calls—will be blocked by modern web browsers unless HTTPS is enabled. If you do not plan to use these features, you can skip this section.

Importance of HTTPS​

For deployments at high risk of traffic interception, such as those hosted on the internet, it is recommended to implement HTTPS encryption. This ensures that the username/password signup and authentication process remains secure, protecting sensitive user data from potential threats.

Choosing Your HTTPS Solution​

The choice of HTTPS encryption solution is up to the user and should align with the existing infrastructure. Here are some common scenarios:

AWS Environments: Utilizing an AWS Elastic Load Balancer is often a practical choice for managing HTTPS. Docker Container Environments: Popular solutions include Nginx, Traefik, and Caddy. Cloudflare: Offers easy HTTPS setup with minimal server-side configuration, suitable for a wide range of applications. Ngrok: Provides a quick way to set up HTTPS for local development environments, particularly useful for testing and demos.
