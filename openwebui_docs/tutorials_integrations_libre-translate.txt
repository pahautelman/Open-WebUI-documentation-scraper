🔠 LibreTranslate Integration

Overview​

LibreTranslate is a free and open-source machine translation API that supports a wide range of languages. LibreTranslate is a self hosted, offline capable, and easy to setup, and unlike other APIs, it doesn't rely on proprietary providers such as Google or Azure to perform translations. Instead, its translation engine is powered by the open source Argos Translate library. You can integrate LibreTranslate with Open WebUI to leverage its machine translation capabilities. This documentation provides a step-by-step guide to setting up LibreTranslate in Docker and configuring the integration within Open WebUI.

Setting up LibreTranslate in Docker​

To set up LibreTranslate in Docker, follow these steps:

Step 1: Create a Docker Compose File​

Create a new file named docker-compose.yml in a directory of your choice. Add the following configuration to the file:

docker-compose.yml

services: libretranslate: container_name: libretranslate image: libretranslate/libretranslate:v1.6.0 restart: unless-stopped ports: - "5000:5000" env_file: - stack.env volumes: - libretranslate_api_keys:/app/db - libretranslate_models:/home/libretranslate/.local:rw tty: true stdin_open: true healthcheck: test: ['CMD-SHELL', './venv/bin/python scripts/healthcheck.py'] volumes: libretranslate_models: libretranslate_api_keys:

services: libretranslate: container_name: libretranslate image: libretranslate/libretranslate:v1.6.0 restart: unless-stopped ports: - "5000:5000" env_file: - stack.env volumes: - libretranslate_api_keys:/app/db - libretranslate_models:/home/libretranslate/.local:rw tty: true stdin_open: true healthcheck: test: ['CMD-SHELL', './venv/bin/python scripts/healthcheck.py'] volumes: libretranslate_models: libretranslate_api_keys:

Step 2: Create a stack.env File​

stack.env

Create a new file named stack.env in the same directory as your docker-compose.yml file. Add the following configuration to the file:

stack.env

docker-compose.yml

# LibreTranslateLT_DEBUG="false"LT_UPDATE_MODELS="true"LT_SSL="false"LT_SUGGESTIONS="false"LT_METRICS="false"LT_HOST="0.0.0.0"LT_API_KEYS="false"LT_THREADS="12"LT_FRONTEND_TIMEOUT="2000"

# LibreTranslateLT_DEBUG="false"LT_UPDATE_MODELS="true"LT_SSL="false"LT_SUGGESTIONS="false"LT_METRICS="false"LT_HOST="0.0.0.0"LT_API_KEYS="false"LT_THREADS="12"LT_FRONTEND_TIMEOUT="2000"

Step 3: Run the Docker Compose File​

Run the following command to start the LibreTranslate service:

docker-compose up -d

docker-compose up -d

This will start the LibreTranslate service in detached mode.

Configuring the Integration in Open WebUI​

Once you have LibreTranslate up and running in Docker, you can configure the integration within Open WebUI. There are several community integrations available, including:

LibreTranslate Filter Function LibreTranslate Action Function MultiLanguage LibreTranslate Action Function LibreTranslate Filter Pipeline

LibreTranslate Filter Function

LibreTranslate Action Function

MultiLanguage LibreTranslate Action Function

LibreTranslate Filter Pipeline

Choose the integration that best suits your needs and follow the instructions to configure it within Open WebUI.

Supported languages for the LibreTranslate pipeline & function: Really just all the languages that can be found within LibreTranslate, but here is the list:

Albanian, Arabic, Azerbaijani, Bengali, Bulgarian, Catalan, Valencian, Chinese, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Flemish, Esperanto, Estonian, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hindi, Hungarian, Indonesian, Irish, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Latvian, Lithuanian, Malay, Persian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Moldavian, Moldovan, Russian, Slovak, Slovenian, Spanish, Castilian, Swedish, Tagalog, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, Urdu

Troubleshooting​

Make sure the LibreTranslate service is running and accessible. Verify that the Docker configuration is correct. Check the LibreTranslate logs for any errors.
