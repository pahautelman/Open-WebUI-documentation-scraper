Open WebUI allows you to integrate directly into your web browser. This tutorial will guide you through the process of setting up Open WebUI as a custom search engine, enabling you to execute queries easily from your browser's address bar.

Setting Up Open WebUI as a Search Engine​

Prerequisites​

Before you begin, ensure that:

You have Chrome or another supported browser installed. The WEBUI_URL environment variable is set correctly, either using Docker environment variables or in the .env file as specified in the Getting Started guide.

Step 1: Set the WEBUI_URL Environment Variable​

Setting the WEBUI_URL environment variable ensures your browser knows where to direct queries.

WEBUI_URL

Using Docker Environment Variables​

If you are running Open WebUI using Docker, you can set the environment variable in your docker run command:

docker run

docker run -d \ -p 3000:8080 \ --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway \ -v open-webui:/app/backend/data \ --name open-webui \ --restart always \ -e WEBUI_URL="https://<your-open-webui-url>" \ ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main

docker run -d \ -p 3000:8080 \ --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway \ -v open-webui:/app/backend/data \ --name open-webui \ --restart always \ -e WEBUI_URL="https://<your-open-webui-url>" \ ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main

Alternatively, you can add the variable to your .env file:

.env

WEBUI_URL=https://<your-open-webui-url>

WEBUI_URL=https://<your-open-webui-url>

Optional: Using Specific Models​

If you wish to utilize a specific model for your search, modify the URL format to include the model ID:

https://<your-open-webui-url>/?models=<model_id>&q=%s

https://<your-open-webui-url>/?models=<model_id>&q=%s

Note: The model ID will need to be URL-encoded. Special characters like spaces or slashes need to be encoded (e.g., my model becomes my%20model).

my model

my%20model

Example Usage​

Once the search engine is set up, you can perform searches directly from the address bar. Simply type your chosen keyword followed by your query:

webui your search query

webui your search query

This command will redirect you to the Open WebUI interface with your search results.

Troubleshooting​

If you encounter any issues, check the following:

Ensure the WEBUI_URL is correctly configured and points to a valid Open WebUI instance. Double-check that the search engine URL format is correctly entered in your browser settings. Confirm your internet connection is active and that the Open WebUI service is running smoothly.
