Copying a Share Link‚Äã

When you select Copy Link, a unique share link is generated that can be shared with others.

Copy Link

Important Considerations:

The shared chat will only include messages that existed at the time the link was created. Any new messages sent within the chat after the link is generated will not be included, unless the link is deleted and updated with a new link. The generated share link acts as a static snapshot of the chat at the time the link was generated. To view the shared chat, users must: Have an account on the Open WebUI instance where the link was generated. Be signed in to their account on that instance. If a user tries to access the shared link without being signed in, they will be redirected to the login page to log in before they can view the shared chat.
