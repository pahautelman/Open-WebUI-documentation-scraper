🖥️ Local LLM Setup with IPEX-LLM on Intel GPU

This tutorial is a community contribution and is not supported by the Open WebUI team. It serves only as a demonstration on how to customize Open WebUI for your specific use case. Want to contribute? Check out the contributing tutorial.

This guide is verified with Open WebUI setup through Manual Installation.

IPEX-LLM is a PyTorch library for running LLM on Intel CPU and GPU (e.g., local PC with iGPU, discrete GPU such as Arc A-Series, Flex and Max) with very low latency.

This tutorial demonstrates how to setup Open WebUI with IPEX-LLM accelerated Ollama backend hosted on Intel GPU. By following this guide, you will be able to setup Open WebUI even on a low-cost PC (i.e. only with integrated GPU) with a smooth experience.

Start Ollama Serve on Intel GPU​

Refer to this guide from IPEX-LLM official documentation about how to install and run Ollama serve accelerated by IPEX-LLM on Intel GPU.

If you would like to reach the Ollama service from another machine, make sure you set or export the environment variable OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0 before executing the command ollama serve.

OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0

ollama serve

Configure Open WebUI​

Access the Ollama settings through Settings -> Connections in the menu. By default, the Ollama Base URL is preset to https://localhost:11434, as illustrated in the snapshot below. To verify the status of the Ollama service connection, click the Refresh button located next to the textbox. If the WebUI is unable to establish a connection with the Ollama server, you will see an error message stating, WebUI could not connect to Ollama.

If the connection is successful, you will see a message stating Service Connection Verified, as illustrated below.

If you want to use an Ollama server hosted at a different URL, simply update the Ollama Base URL to the new URL and press the Refresh button to re-confirm the connection to Ollama.
