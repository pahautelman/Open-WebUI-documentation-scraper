Keep Open WebUI Thriving: Support Continuous Innovation​

Even if you don’t need an enterprise license, consider becoming a sponsor to help fund continuous development.

It’s an investment in stability, longevity, and ongoing improvements. A well-funded Open WebUI means fewer bugs, fewer security concerns, and a more feature-rich platform that stays ahead of industry trends. The cost of sponsoring is a fraction of what it would take to build, maintain, and support an equivalent AI system internally.

Open WebUI is fully open source, and you can use it for free. However, building, maintaining, supporting, and evolving such a powerful AI platform requires significant effort, time, and resources. Infrastructure costs, security updates, continuous improvements, and keeping up with the latest AI advancements all demand dedicated engineering, operational, and research efforts.

If Open WebUI helps your business save time, money, or resources, we encourage you to consider supporting its development. As an independently funded project, sponsorship enables us to maintain a fast iteration cycle to keep up with the rapid advancements in AI. Your support directly contributes to critical features, security enhancements, performance improvements, and integrations that benefit everyone—including you. Open WebUI will continue to offer the same feature set without requiring an enterprise license, ensuring accessibility for all users.

💙 Sponsor Open WebUI – Join our existing backers in keeping Open WebUI thriving.

Whether through enterprise partnerships, contributions, or financial backing, your support plays a crucial role in sustaining this powerful AI platform for businesses worldwide.
