🪝 Webhook Integrations

Overview​

Open WebUI provides a webhook feature that allows you to receive notifications automatically whenever new users sign up to your instance. This is done by providing a webhook URL to Open WebUI, which will then send notifications to that URL when a new user account is created.

Configuring Webhooks in Open WebUI​

You will need to obtain a webhook URL from an external service that supports webhooks, such as a Discord channel or a Slack workspace. This URL will be used to receive notifications from Open WebUI.

To configure webhooks in Open WebUI, you have two options:

Option 1: Configure through the Admin Interface​

Log in to your Open WebUI instance as an administrator. Navigate to the Admin Panel. Click the Settings tab located at the top. From there, navigate to the General sectionn of the setting in the admin panel. Locate the Webhook URL field and enter the webhook URL. Save the changes.

Option 2: Configure through Environment Variables​

Alternatively, you can configure the webhook URL by setting the WEBHOOK_URL environment variable. For more information on environment variables in Open WebUI, see Environment Variable Configuration.

Step 3: Verify the Webhook​

To verify that the webhook is working correctly, create a new user account in Open WebUI. If the webhook is configured correctly, you should receive a notification at the specified webhook URL.

Webhook Payload Format​

The webhook payload sent by Open WebUI is in plain text and contains a simple notification message about the new user account. The payload format is as follows:

New user signed up: <username>

New user signed up: <username>

For example, if a user named "Tim" signs up, the payload sent would be:

New user signed up: Tim

New user signed up: Tim

Troubleshooting​

Make sure the webhook URL is correct and properly formatted. Verify that the webhook service is enabled and configured correctly. Check the Open WebUI logs for any errors related to the webhook. Verify the connection hasn't been interrupted or blocked by a firewall or proxy. The webhook server could be temporarily unavailable or experiencing high latency. If provided through the webhook service, verify if the Webhook API key is invalid, expired, or revoked.
