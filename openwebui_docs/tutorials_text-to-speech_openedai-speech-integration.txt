What is openedai-speech?​

openedai-speech

openedai-speech is an OpenAI audio/speech API compatible text-to-speech server.

It serves the /v1/audio/speech endpoint and provides a free, private text-to-speech experience with custom voice cloning capabilities. This service is in no way affiliated with OpenAI and does not require an OpenAI API key.

/v1/audio/speech

Requirements​

Docker installed on your system Open WebUI running in a Docker container Basic understanding of Docker and Docker Compose

Docker installed on your system

Open WebUI running in a Docker container

Basic understanding of Docker and Docker Compose

Option 1: Using Docker Compose​

Step 1: Create a new folder for the openedai-speech service​

openedai-speech

Create a new folder, for example, openedai-speech-service, to store the docker-compose.yml and speech.env files.

openedai-speech-service

docker-compose.yml

speech.env

Step 2: Clone the openedai-speech repository from GitHub​

openedai-speech

git clone https://github.com/matatonic/openedai-speech.git

git clone https://github.com/matatonic/openedai-speech.git

This will download the openedai-speech repository to your local machine, which includes the Docker Compose files (docker-compose.yml, docker-compose.min.yml, and docker-compose.rocm.yml) and other necessary files.

openedai-speech

docker-compose.yml

docker-compose.min.yml

docker-compose.rocm.yml

Step 3: Rename the sample.env file to speech.env (Customize if needed)​

sample.env

speech.env

In the openedai-speech repository folder, create a new file named speech.env with the following contents:

openedai-speech

speech.env

TTS_HOME=voicesHF_HOME=voices#PRELOAD_MODEL=xtts#PRELOAD_MODEL=xtts_v2.0.2#PRELOAD_MODEL=parler-tts/parler_tts_mini_v0.1#EXTRA_ARGS=--log-level DEBUG --unload-timer 300#USE_ROCM=1

TTS_HOME=voicesHF_HOME=voices#PRELOAD_MODEL=xtts#PRELOAD_MODEL=xtts_v2.0.2#PRELOAD_MODEL=parler-tts/parler_tts_mini_v0.1#EXTRA_ARGS=--log-level DEBUG --unload-timer 300#USE_ROCM=1

Step 4: Choose a Docker Compose file​

You can use any of the following Docker Compose files:

docker-compose.yml: This file uses the ghcr.io/matatonic/openedai-speech image and builds from Dockerfile. docker-compose.min.yml: This file uses the ghcr.io/matatonic/openedai-speech-min image and builds from Dockerfile.min. This image is a minimal version that only includes Piper support and does not require a GPU. docker-compose.rocm.yml: This file uses the ghcr.io/matatonic/openedai-speech-rocm image and builds from Dockerfile with ROCm support.

docker-compose.yml: This file uses the ghcr.io/matatonic/openedai-speech image and builds from Dockerfile.

ghcr.io/matatonic/openedai-speech

docker-compose.min.yml: This file uses the ghcr.io/matatonic/openedai-speech-min image and builds from Dockerfile.min. This image is a minimal version that only includes Piper support and does not require a GPU.

ghcr.io/matatonic/openedai-speech-min

docker-compose.rocm.yml: This file uses the ghcr.io/matatonic/openedai-speech-rocm image and builds from Dockerfile with ROCm support.

ghcr.io/matatonic/openedai-speech-rocm

Step 4: Build the Chosen Docker Image​

Before running the Docker Compose file, you need to build the Docker image:

Model Details:​

openedai-speech supports multiple text-to-speech models, each with its own strengths and requirements. The following models are available:

openedai-speech

Piper TTS (very fast, runs on CPU): Use your own Piper voices via the voice_to_speaker.yaml configuration file. This model is great for applications that require low latency and high performance. Piper TTS also supports multilingual voices. Coqui AI/TTS XTTS v2 (fast, but requires around 4GB GPU VRAM & Nvidia GPU with CUDA): This model uses Coqui AI's XTTS v2 voice cloning technology to generate high-quality voices. While it requires a more powerful GPU, it provides excellent performance and high-quality audio. Coqui also supports multilingual voices. Beta Parler-TTS Support (experimental, slower): This model uses the Parler-TTS framework to generate voices. While it's currently in beta, it allows you to describe very basic features of the speaker voice. The exact voice will be slightly different with each generation, but should be similar to the speaker description provided. For inspiration on how to describe voices, see Text Description to Speech.

Troubleshooting​

If you encounter any problems integrating openedai-speech with Open WebUI, follow these troubleshooting steps:

openedai-speech

Verify openedai-speech service: Ensure that the openedai-speech service is running and the port you specified in the docker-compose.yml file is exposed. Check access to host.docker.internal: Verify that the hostname host.docker.internal is resolvable from within the Open WebUI container. This is necessary because openedai-speech is exposed via localhost on your PC, but open-webui cannot normally access it from inside its container. You can add a volume to the docker-compose.yml file to mount a file from the host to the container, for example, to a directory that will be served by openedai-speech. Review API key configuration: Make sure the API key is set to a dummy value or effectively left unchecked because openedai-speech doesn't require an API key. Check voice configuration: Verify that the voice you are trying to use for TTS exists in your voice_to_speaker.yaml file and the corresponding files (e.g., voice XML files) are present in the correct directory. Verify voice model paths: If you're experiencing issues with voice model loading, double-check that the paths in your voice_to_speaker.yaml file match the actual locations of your voice models.

FAQ​

How can I control the emotional range of the generated audio?

There is no direct mechanism to control the emotional output of the generated audio. Certain factors such as capitalization or grammar may affect the output audio, but internal testing has yielded mixed results.

Where are the voice files stored? What about the configuration file?.

The configuration files, which define the available voices and their properties, are stored in the config volume. Specifically, the default voices are defined in voice_to_speaker.default.yaml.
